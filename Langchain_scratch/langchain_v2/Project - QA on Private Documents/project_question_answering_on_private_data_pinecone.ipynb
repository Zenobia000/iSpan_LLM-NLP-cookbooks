      "OpenAI LP ist ein US-amerikanisches Unternehmen, das sich mit der Erforschung von künstlicher Intelligenz (KI, englisch Artificial Intelligence, AI) beschäftigt. Die gewinnorientierte Tochtergesellschaft OpenAI LP wird dabei durch das Non-Profit-Mutterunternehmen OpenAI Inc. kontrolliert.\n",
      "Zentrale Geldgeber der Organisation sind der Unternehmer Elon Musk sowie das Unternehmen Microsoft. Stand 2015 war das Ziel von OpenAI, künstliche Intelligenz auf Open-Source-Basis auf eine Art und Weise zu entwickeln und zu vermarkten, dass sie der Gesellschaft Vorteile bringt und nicht schadet. Die Organisation wollte eine „freie Zusammenarbeit“ mit anderen Institutionen und Forschern, indem sie ihre Patente und Forschungsergebnisse für die Öffentlichkeit zugänglich mache. Die Firma ist mit über 1 Milliarde US-Dollar von Spenden finanziert.OpenAI beschäftigt sich nach eigenen Angaben mit der Frage der „existenziellen Bedrohung durch künstliche Intelligenz“ – also dem möglichen Übertreffen und Ersetzen der menschlichen durch künstliche Intelligenz (KI). Die Organisation dient bis jetzt nur der Erforschung künstlicher Intelligenz. Im Februar 2018 verließ Elon Musk die Leitung von OpenAI, um angeblich Interessenkonflikte mit Teslas Entwicklungen im Bereich künstliche Intelligenz zu vermeiden. Er bleibt weiterhin Spender und Berater der Organisation.\n",

      "Die Wissenschaftler Stephen Hawking und Stuart Jonathan Russell äußerten Befürchtungen, dass – wenn künstliche Intelligenz eines Tages die Fähigkeit erlangen könnte, sich selbst zu verbessern – dies zu einer „Explosion der Intelligenz“ führen könnte. Durch die damit einhergehende Überlegenheit der KI sei eine Verdrängung der Spezies Mensch durch superintelligente künstliche Intelligenz denkbar, die keinen menschlichen Wertvorstellungen unterworfen ist.\n",
      "Elon Musk, Mitbegründer von OpenAI, bezeichnet künstliche Intelligenz als größte existenzielle Gefahr für die Menschheit. Um diesem Risiko bei der Entwicklung künstlicher Intelligenz entgegenzutreten, wurde OpenAI als Open-source non-profit-Organisation konzipiert. Damit sollte die Unabhängigkeit der Organisation gegenüber Geldgebern und deren Interessen sichergestellt werden; für die Forschung sollte der Freiraum geschaffen werden, sich auf lange Sicht positiv auf die Gesellschaft auswirken zu können.Das Unternehmen OpenAI selbst gibt zu bedenken, dass es schwer abzuschätzen sei, wie sehr die Gesellschaft von hochwertiger künstlicher Intelligenz profitieren könnte. Genauso komplex sei im Gegenzug zu eruieren, welchen Schaden eine missbräuchliche Verwendung dieser Technologie mit sich bringen könnte. Aus heutiger Sicht sei es obendrein auch nicht absehbar, wann künstliche Intelligenz auf dem Level sein würde, mit der menschlichen Intelligenz in Konkurrenz zu treten. Der Vorstand von OpenAI ist jedenfalls überzeugt, dass künstliche Intelligenz eine Erweiterung des individuellen menschlichen Willens sei. Damit sollte diese Technologie auch flächendeckend verfügbar und jedem Menschen im gleichen Maße zugänglich sein. Ein Übertreffen der menschlichen Intelligenz durch das auf mehrere Jahrzehnte konzipierte Projekt OpenAI ist für den Ko-Vorsitzenden des Unternehmens, Sam Altman, jedenfalls denkbar.Für den Vorstandsvorsitzenden von Infosys, Vishal Sikka, war die Offenlegung der Entwicklung von OpenAI maßgeblich für seine Unterstützung. Dabei war zentral, dass das Bestreben von OpenAI darin liegt, dass die Forschung stets „the greater good“ – also eine ganzheitlich positive Absicht für die Menschheit – im Fokus hatte. Cade Metz von Wired sagte, dass Firmen wie  Amazon Interesse an der Verwendung von Open-Source Software und Open-Source Data hätten, um sich gegen Unternehmen wie Google oder Facebook zu behaupten, die über eine starke proprietäre Datenbasis verfügen. Firmen von Y Combinator teilen ihre Daten ebenfalls mit OpenAI, so Altman in einem Interview.Ob OpenAI weiterhin eine non-profit-Organisation ist, wird inzwischen teilweise bestrit\n"
